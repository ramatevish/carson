An integrated dispatcher and scheduled event queue for use with the RaspberryPi. With the RaspberryPi one can readily turn mainline devices on and off with the help of relays, and with LIRC, it can also control devices via infra-red signaling. Carson allows for easy, centralized, asynchrous dispatching of pre-defined hardware / software commands. Named after Jim Carter's character on Downton Abbey, Charles Carson.
